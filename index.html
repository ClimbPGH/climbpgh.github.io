          <h1> Mission Statement </h1>
          <p><i>Climb Pittsburgh</i> intends to bring together the appropriate stakeholders in the outdoor recreational community and the City of Pittsburgh in order to provide area residents with 
            <ol>
              <li> The opportunity to learn the fundamentals of rock climbing in order to safely practice this activity within our city limits. </li> 
              <li> The access to the necessary equipment and facilities to practice this activity at zero cost to the city of Pittsburgh and zero cost to themselves. </li>
            </ol>
            Traditionally, rock climbing has been an activity of privilege dependent upon the ability to travel and acquire specialized gear and mentorship. Our goal is to eliminate these hurdles by installing and maintaining climbing routes within our city green-spaces, and providing interested residents and visitors with open access to these climbing areas.

            The walls underneath the Panther Hollow Bridge are close to 70’ high. The featured nature of the individual blocks that form these walls creates an endless variety of natural climbing holds.  By placing top anchors at a suitable distance beneath the bridge, there would never be a need for climbers to be on top of the bridge nor to be recreating anywhere near the Boulevard.  All activity would be contained in the park below.  Given its location in the heart of one of Pittsburgh’s most beloved City Parks, we feel this would be a major destination for outdoor enthusiasts.

              The <i>Seldom Seen Greenway</i> has a several decade-long history of urban climbing in Pittsburgh and has the potential to yield the greatest number of climbing routes in the area.  We have visions of transforming this space from the underutilized “secret crag” that it currently is to a shared treasure of outdoor recreation that will prove to be a destination worthy of regional travel.  Much of the hardware installed in these various walls are 20-30 years old and needs to be replaced to keep things safe.<i>Climb Pittsburgh</i> would love to partner with the City of Pittsburgh to care for this space.
